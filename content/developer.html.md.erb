This document describes how a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) app developer can choose a service plan, create and delete Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) service instances, and bind an app.

You must install the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) (cf CLI) to run the commands in this topic.

## Viewing All Plans Available for Pivotal Cloud Cache

Run `cf marketplace -s p-cloudcache` to view all plans available for PCC. The plan names displayed are configured by the operator on tile installation.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf marketplace -s p-cloudcache

Getting service plan information for service p-cloudcache as admin...
OK

service plan   description      free or paid
extra-small    Caching Plan 1   free
small          Caching Plan 2   free
medium         Caching Plan 3   free
large          Caching Plan 4   free
extra-large    Caching Plan 5   free
</pre>

## <a id="create"></a> Creating a Pivotal Cloud Cache Service Instance

Run `cf create-service p-cloudcache PLAN-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to create a service instance. Replace `PLAN-NAME` with the name from the list of available plans. Replace `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with a name of your choice. You use this name to refer to your service instance with other commands. Service instance names can include alpha-numeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf create-service p-cloudcache extra-large my-cloudcache
</pre>

Service instances are created asynchronously. Run the `cf services` command to view the current status of the service creation, and of other service instances in the current org and space:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf services
Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user...
OK

name            service        plan    bound apps   last operation
my-cloudcache   p-cloudcache   small                create in progress
</pre>

When completed, the status changes from `create in progress` to `create succeeded`.

### <a id="params"></a> Provide Optional Parameters

You can create a customized service instance by passing optional parameters to `cf create-service` using the `-c` flag. The `-c` flag accepts a valid JSON object containing service-specific configuration parameters, provided either in-line or in a file. 

The PCC service broker supports the following parameters:

- `num_servers`: An integer that specifies the number of server instances in the cluster. The minimum value is `4`. The maximum and default values are configured by operator. 
- `new_size_percentage`: An integer that specifies the percentage of the heap to allocate to young generation. This value must be between `5` and `83`. By default, the new size is 2&nbsp;GB or 10% of heap, whichever is smaller.

The following example creates the service with five service instances in the cluster: 

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf create-service p-cloudcache small my-cloudcache -c '{"num_servers": 5}'
</pre>

### <a id="ssc"></a> Enable Session State Caching with the Java Buildpack

When the service instance name is followed by the `session-replication` tag, the Java buildpack will download all the required resources for session state caching.

To enable session state caching, do one of the following: 

+ When creating your service instance name, append it with the `session-replication` tag. For example, for the `p-cloudcache` service:

    <pre class='terminal'>
     $ cf create-service p-cloudcache my-service-instance -t session-replication</pre> 

* When updating your service instance name (for example, if the updated name is `new-service-instance`), append it with the `session-replication` tag:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf update-service new-service-instance -t session-replication</pre>

* End the service instance name with the text `-session-replication`:
 `my-service-instance-session-replication`.

## <a id="update-service-instance"></a> Updating a Pivotal Cloud Cache Service Instance

You  can apply all optional parameters to an existing service instance using the `cf update-service` command. You can, for example, scale up a cluster by increasing the number of servers.

Previously specified optional parameters are persisted through subsequent updates. To return the service instance to default values, you must explicitly specify the defaults as optional parameters. 

For example, if you create a service instance with five servers using a plan that has a default value of four servers:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf create-service p-cloudcache small my-cloudcache -c '{"num_servers": 5}'
</pre>

And you set the `new_size_percentage` to 50%:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf update-service my-cloudcache -c '{"new_size_percentage": 50}'
</pre>

Then the resulting service instance has `5` servers and `new_size_percentage` of 50% of heap.

### <a id="cluster-rebalancing"></a>Cluster Rebalancing

When updating a cluster to increase the number of servers, the available heap size is increased. When this happens, PCC automatically rebalances data in the cache to distribute data across the cluster.

This automatic rebalancing does not occur when a server leaves the cluster and later rejoins, for example when a VM is re-created, or network connectivity lost and restored. In this case, you must manually rebalance the cluster using the gfsh [`rebalance` command](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/rebalance.html) while authenticated as a cluster operator.


## <a id="plan-updates"></a> About Changes to the Service Plan

Your PCF operator can change details of the service plan available on the Marketplace. If your operator changes the default value of one of the optional parameters, this does not affect existing service instances. 

However, if your operator changes the allowed values of one of the optional parameters, existing instances that exceed the new limits are not affected, but any subsequent service updates that change the optional parameter must adhere to the new limits.

For example, if the PCF operator changes the plan by decreasing the maximum value for `num_servers`, any future service updates must adhere to the new `num_servers` value limit.

You may see the following error message when attempting to update a service instance:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf update-service  my-cloudcache -c '{"num_servers": 5}'
Updating service instance my-cloudcache as admin...
FAILED
Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: Service cannot be updated at this time, please try again later or contact your operator for more information
</pre>

This error message indicates that the operator has made an update to the plan used by this service instance. You must wait for the operator to apply plan changes to all service instances before you can make further service instance updates.

## <a id="accessing"></a> Accessing a Service Instance

Once you have created a service instance, you can start accessing it. Usually you should set up cache regions before using your service instance from a deployed CF app. You can do this with the gfsh command line tool. To connect, you must set up a service key.

### <a id="create-service-key"></a> Create Service Keys

Service keys provide a way to access your service instance outside the scope of a deployed CF app. Run `cf create-service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME KEY-NAME` to create  a service key. Replace `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the name you chose for your service instance. Replace `KEY-NAME` with a name of your choice. You use this name to refer to your service key with other commands. 

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf create-service-key my-cloudcache my-service-key
</pre>

Run `cf create-service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME KEY-NAME` to view the newly created service key.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf service-key my-cloudcache my-service-key
</pre>

The `cf service-key` returns output in the following format:

<pre class='terminal'>
{
  "locators": [
    "10.244.0.66[55221]",
    "10.244.0.4[55221]",
    "10.244.0.3[55221]"
  ],
  "urls": {
    "gfsh": "<gfsh-url>",
    "pulse": "<pulse-url>"
  },
  "users": [
    {
      "password": "<developer-password>",
      "username": "developer"
    },
    {
      "password": "<cluster_operator-password>",
      "username": "cluster_operator"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

This returned structure contains the following information:

* `cluster_operator` and `developer` credentials
* `gfsh-url`: A URL usable to connect the gfsh client to the service instance
* `pulse-url`: A URL usable to view the Pulse dashboard in a web browser, which allows monitoring of the service-instance status. You can use the developer credentials to authenticate.

The `cluster_operator` and `developer` roles provide access to different functions on the service instance. 

You can use the `cluster_operator` credentials to administer the service instance. For example, you can use the `cluster_operator` credentials to define or delete cache regions.

You can use the `developer` credentials to perform create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) data operations. You can also use the `cluster_operator` credentials to perform the same functions the `developer` credentials. As a best practice, you should use the role with the least amount of permissions necessary.

### <a id="gfsh-connect"></a> Connect with gfsh

You can manage your cluster and data with the `gfsh` command-line interface. PCC works with `gfsh`.

Check the product [snapshot](/p-cloud-cache/index.html#snapshot) of the PCC version you're using to determine which version of `gfsh` you need in order to connect to your cluster. 
For example, if your tile package uses GemFire v9.0.4, you should be using a 9.0.4 version of the `gfsh` client.

To install gfsh:

1. Download the Pivotal GemFire ZIP archive from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gemfire)
1. Unzip and locate the correct binary for your architecture (`gfsh` for unix or `gfsh.bats` for windows)
1. Add the `gfsh` binary to your path

Start the `gfsh` command-line tool:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ gfsh
    _________________________     __
   / _____/ ______/ ______/ /____/ /
  / /  __/ /___  /_____  / _____  /
 / /__/ / ____/  _____/ / /    / /
/______/_/      /______/_/    /_/    9.0.1

Monitor and Manage Pivotal GemFire
gfsh>
</pre>

From the `gfsh>` prompt, connect to your service instance as `cluster_operator`:

<pre class='terminal'>
gfsh>connect --use-http --url=<gfsh-url> --user=cluster_operator --password=<cluster_operator-password>
</pre>

### Workaround Connect with gfsh over HTTPS

Connecting over HTTPS is a bit more work than HTTP, but it is required for some network setups.
The additional steps are:

1. Creating a truststore. 
2. Setting an environment variable before you start gfsh.

Before you start this process, you'll need to have your ERT environment certificate handy.

#### Create a truststore that contains the ERT certificate

We suggest using the `keytool` command line utility to create a truststore file.
You'll pass in your ERT certificate file with the `-file` flag, and the path for the output truststore file with the `-keystore` flag.

When you run this command, you will be prompted to enter a keystore password. Create a password and remember it!
You will then be prompted with the certificate details. Type **yes** to trust the certificate.

Here is an example of how to run `keytool` and what the output looks like:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ keytool -import -alias &lt;env&gt;-ssl -file &lt;path-to-ERT-cert&gt; -keystore &lt;env&gt;.truststore
Enter keystore password:
Re-enter new password:
Owner: CN=*.url.example.com, OU=Cloud Foundry, O=Pivotal, L=New York, ST=New York, C=US
Issuer: CN=*.url.example.com, OU=Cloud Foundry, O=Pivotal, L=New York, ST=New York, C=US

Valid from: Sat Jul 29 09:18:43 EDT 2017 until: Mon Apr 07 09:18:43 EDT 2031
Certificate fingerprints:
	 MD5:  A9:17:B1:C9:6C:0A:F7:A3:56:51:6D:67:F8:3E:94:35
	 SHA1: BA:DA:23:09:17:C0:DF:37:D9:6F:47:05:05:00:44:6B:24:A1:3D:77

  DNSName: *.url.example.com
  DNSName: *.ws.url.example.com
]

Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
Certificate was added to keystore
</pre>

#### Setting the Environment Variable

Now that you've created a truststore file, you'll need to tell gfsh to use it.
The way to do that is to set the `JAVA_ARGS` environment variable, before starting gfsh.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ export JAVA_ARGS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=&lt;path to generated truststore&gt;"
</pre>

#### Connect over HTTPS
This part is nearly the same as over HTTP; just make sure to use a url starting with `https`. 

Open the gfsh console and connect via https:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ gfsh
    _________________________     __
   / _____/ ______/ ______/ /____/ /
  / /  __/ /___  /_____  / _____  /
 / /__/ / ____/  _____/ / /    / /
/______/_/      /______/_/    /_/    9.0.1

gfsh>connect --use-http --url=https-gfsh-url --user=cluster_operator --password=cluster_operator-password
</pre>

## <a id="use"></a> Using Pivotal Cloud Cache
### <a id="create-regions"></a> Create Regions with gfsh

After connecting with gfsh as a `cluster_operator`, you can define a new cache region.

The following command creates a partitioned region with a single redundant copy:

<pre class='terminal'>
gfsh>create region --name=my-cache-region --type=PARTITION_HEAP_LRU --redundant-copies=1
     Member      | Status
---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------
cacheserver-z2-1 | Region "/my-cache-region" created on "cacheserver-z2-1"
cacheserver-z3-2 | Region "/my-cache-region" created on "cacheserver-z3-2"
cacheserver-z1-0 | Region "/my-cache-region" created on "cacheserver-z1-0"
cacheserver-z1-3 | Region "/my-cache-region" created on "cacheserver-z1-3"
</pre>

The following region types are recommended for PCC:

* `PARTITION_HEAP_LRU`
* `REPLICATE_HEAP_LRU`

To achieve optimal performance, you should understand the type of region that is relevant to your situation. For more information, see the Pivotal GemFire [Region Types](http://gemfire90.docs.pivotal.io/90/geode/developing/region_options/region_types.html) documentation.

You can test the newly created region by writing and reading values with gfsh:

<pre class='terminal'>
gfsh>put --region=/my-cache-region --key=test --value=thevalue
Result      : true
Key Class   : java.lang.String
Key         : test
Value Class : java.lang.String
Old Value   : <NULL>


gfsh>get --region=/my-cache-region --key=test
Result      : true
Key Class   : java.lang.String
Key         : test
Value Class : java.lang.String
Value       : thevalue
</pre>

In practice, you should perform these get/put operations from a deployed PCF app. To do this, you must bind the service instance to these apps.

### <a id="bind-service"></a> Bind an App to a Service Instance

Binding your apps to a service instance enables the apps to connect to the service instance and read or write data to the region. 
Run `cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to bind an app to your service instance. 
Replace `APP-NAME` with the name of the app. 
Replace `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the name you chose for your service instance.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf bind-service my-app my-cloudcache
</pre>

Binding an app to the service instance provides connection information through the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
Your app can use this information to configure components, such as the GemFire client cache, to use the service instance. 

The following is a sample `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable:

```
{
  "p-cloudcache": [
    {
      "credentials": {
	"locators": [
	  "10.244.0.4[55221]",
	  "10.244.1.2[55221]",
	  "10.244.0.130[55221]"
	],
	"urls": {
	  "gfsh": "http://cloudcache-5574c540-1464-4f9e-b56b-74d8387cb50d.local.pcfdev.io/gemfire/v1",
	  "pulse": "http://cloudcache-5574c540-1464-4f9e-b56b-74d8387cb50d.local.pcfdev.io/pulse"
	},
	"users": [
	  {
	    "password": "some_developer_password",
	    "username": "developer"
	  },
	  {
	    "password": "some_password",
	    "username": "cluster_operator"
	  }
	]
      },
      "label": "p-cloudcache",
      "name": "test-service",
      "plan": "caching-small",
      "provider": null,
      "syslog_drain_url": null,
      "tags": [],
      "volume_mounts": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### <a id="sample-java-app-connect"></a> A Sample Java Client App for Pivotal Cloud Cache

A sample app in pure Java has been written to demonstrate how to connect an app to the service instance.

The code is available at [https://github.com/cf-gemfire-org/cloudcache-sample-app.git](https://github.com/cf-gemfire-org/cloudcache-sample-app.git)

The code assumes that you have already created a region named `test` in your cluster using `gfsh` as described in the section above.

Apache Geode 1.0.0 is currently the only version that works to connect to our version of GemFire, which is listed in the `build.gradle`.

Follow these steps to deploy the sample app:

1. Modify the sample manifest, replacing `service0` with the name of your service. 


    ```
---
applications:
- name: sample_app
  path: build/libs/cloudcache-sample-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
  no-route: true
  health-check-type: none
  services:
  - service0  
    ```

1. To deploy the app, run the `cf push` command:

    ```
  $ cf push -f /path/to/manifest
    ```

After the app is pushed and started, there should be an entry in the `test` region where `key=1` and `value=one`.

### <a id="pulse"></a> Use the Pulse Dashboard

You can access the Pulse dashboard for a service instance by accessing the pulse-url you [obtained from a service key](#create-service-key) in a web browser.

Use either the `cluster_operator` or `developer` credentials to authenticate.

### <a id="exporting_logs"></a> Export gfsh Logs

You can get logs and `.gfs` stats files from your PCC service instances using the `export logs` command in gfsh.

1. Use the [Connect with gfsh](#gfsh-connect) procedure to connect to the service instance for which you want to see logs.
1. Run `export logs`.
1. Find the ZIP file in the directory where you started gfsh. 
   This file contains a folder for each member of the cluster.
   The member folder contains the associated log files and stats files for that member.

For more information about the gfsh export command,
see the [gfsh export documentation](https://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/export.html).

## <a id="delete"></a> Deleting a Service Instance

You can delete service instances using the cf CLI. Before doing so, you must remove any existing service keys and app bindings.

1. Run `cf delete-service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME KEY-NAME` to delete the service key.
1. Run `cf unbind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to unbind your app from the service instance.
1. Run `cf delete-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to delete the service instance.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf delete-service-key my-cloudcache my-service-key
$ cf unbind-service my-app my-cloudcache
$ cf delete-service my-cloudcache
</pre>

Deletions are asynchronous. Run `cf services` to view the current status of the service instance deletion.
